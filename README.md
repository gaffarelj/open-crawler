Open crawler, visiting all of internet, finding keywords, and making a search engine.

The wiki scripts are visiting all pages of wikipedia, to save all of the individual words that exist on them. This is done to avoid having to save all words that exists on the entire web, and save database space.

The web scrips visit all pages of the entire web, to find the words saved from wikipedia, associate weights to them depending on how important they are on the page, and save this in a database, to further be used as a search engine.
